1. toString not overridden AddressBook and Contact class.
2. The order of import is not according to style guide specification.
3. Spacing is not proper - line 123.
4. In functions that throw exceptions there aren't comments about it.
5. The catch lines of exceptions have arguments like 'e', 'o'. This should be more descriptive.
6. Space between '(' and '{' is not maintained anywhere in the code.
7. Doesn't make sense to say autogenerated code in public like function like equals and hashcode of both Contact and AddressBook.
8. Not sure, but including * in the import statements. 
9. BuilderClass should have been provided with proper name.
10.Not sure if it is a good idea to return false from a function indicating to user that function failed when in reality exception has been thrown.Ex: importContact of AddressBook.
11.Did not include address as part of different information to store.
